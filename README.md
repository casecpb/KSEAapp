## Welcome to the GitHub page for the KSEAapp R Package!

### Overview

The KSEAapp R package offers a panel of functions for kinase activity inference on an input phosphoproteomics dataset using the Kinase-Substrate Enrichment Analysis (KSEA) method originally described by Casado *et al.* (see references below). 

For details on its usage and features, please read the Overview.Rmd file within the **vignettes** folder.

Note: if you are interested in performing KSEA through a user-friendly online interface, please visit our [sister site](https://github.com/casecpb/KSEA).

### Page Contents

1. **data** folder: collection of all the sample datasets in .RData format
2. **man** folder: collection of documentation files
3. **R** folder: collection of the raw R functions found within the package
4. **vignettes** folder: currently contains an Overview.Rmd file that walks readers through the functionality of the package. This is a good starting point for understanding how to use the available functions.
5. DESCRIPTION file
6. LICENSE file
7. NAMESPACE file


Elements found in 2, 5, 6, and 7 are key components for building the R package but are not crucial for understanding the basis of the KSEA calculations.

### Package Installation

There are 2 options for installing the KSEAapp package within the R console:

**(1) Via CRAN**

This gives access to the newest [CRAN release version](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=KSEAapp). 
```
install.packages("KSEAapp")
```

**(2) Via GitHub**

This gives access to the newest development version. 
```
install.packages("devtools") # this installs the devtools R package 
devtools::install_github("casecpb/KSEAapp")
```
